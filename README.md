# BlockchainProject
CSE297 Blockchain project in Golang

## To install Golang
Go to this link: https://golang.org/doc/install and follow instructions.
Then clone this repo to your device in the right location
	- Note: that if your $GOPATH is Go/bin/go, all go source code goes inside the director Go/src

## To Build and Run
To run simply type `go run main.go` and this will execute the program.

To buld type `go build main.go` and this will create an executable main.exe and can be run by typing `./main.exe`

## Notes on workflow
Nobody should work in master. We should all make our own respective branches to work in and only keep the master copy in master. Preferably, we create PRs to be reviewed by somebody before merging master.
